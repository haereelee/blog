I despise the design of Microsoft 10 as someone who has used the earlier versions of Windows and Microsoft a decade ago. I have made the switch to Apple products since then but it's still interesting to see if Microsoft makes their designs more usable.


For app developers, Microsoft has even brought AI into the mix.


Is AI the future in development? I think so.
