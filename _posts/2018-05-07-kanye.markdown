Kanye tweeted a pic of anatomical sketches supposedly for his clothing line.

His brand, Yeezy, is collaborated through Adidas.
These sketches were from Tony Spackman, a designer that had worked at Nike. Ye had posted a photoshopped version of Spackman's original sketches.

Kanye addressed the controversy, stating that a new designer to his brand had "presented work that was not of their own" and was promptly fired from the brand.
