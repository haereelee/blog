title: "Marketing To Young Women: It's Not Just Pink Anymore"
description: "Changing the way that we market to girls"

I loved the following quote:
"For young girls, there is no glass ceiling, there are only incredible opportunities."

It's true that for young girls they don't understand the social limitations that are placed on them when they're older. They just see the endless possibilities for their futures, and it's the grown-ups that dictate what is suitable for females and males.

There's really no reason to have everything pink for it to be marketable for women. It shouldn't be just about pink but also the empowerment of women and the roles that the young girls can have in society when they're older.
